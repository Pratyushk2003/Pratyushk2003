Projects
Here are some of the notable projects I've worked on:

# GitHub Automated Analysis Project

Description: In this project, I build a Python-based tool that takes input from a GitHub userâ€™s URL and returns the most 
technically complex and challenging repository from that user profile.
The tool used is GPT to access each repository individually before determining the most technically 
challenging one.
Technologies: Python, Machine Learning Libraries
Repository: https://github.com/Pratyushk2003/GIT-Analysis-Project-Mercor

# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

Description: I used the Card Transactions dataset to classify credit card transactions into fraudulent and genuine. Then
fit it over the different models and plot ROC curves for them.
Technologies: Python, Machine Learning Libraries
Repository: https://github.com/Pratyushk2003/Credit-Card-Fraud
Feel free to explore my repositories to discover more about my work.
